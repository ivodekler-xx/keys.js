The goal of this simple script is to minimize keyboard hassle,
it has a very easy implementation and hopefully not too many bugs.

documentation


startup: var myKL = new Keylistener({
	'name', {enabled: true}
});

myKey = myKL.addKey({
	[keyCode: 75/KeyName: 'k'],		//when no keyCode or keyName is supplied, key will be set to next key pressed.
	[press: function],
	[whilepressed: { run: function,
			delay: ms }],
	[release: function],
	(once created: pressed: boolean)
});

Also, an array of listened pressed keys is available in myKL.pressedkeys!


update: changing a key is now as simple as changing it's keyCode or keyName!
